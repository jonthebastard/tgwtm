From my education, I'm highly proficient in analog studio recording, digital audio workstations, and advanced audio editing -- but those are mostly just for fun these days. When I'm not behind the camera, you can often find me perusing the Bay Area food scene -- whether that be for fine dining, bespoke cocktails, or incredibly tart sour beers.
